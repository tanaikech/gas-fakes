# <img src="./logo.png" alt="gas-fakes logo" width="50" align="top"> New Features: Cloud Logging and Upstash Integration

This document details two major new features in `gas-fakes`: direct integration with Google Cloud Logging and the ability to use Upstash Redis as a shared backend for `PropertiesService` and `CacheService`.

---

## Cloud Logging Integration

`gas-fakes` now fully emulates the native Google Apps Script `Logger.log()` integration with Google Cloud Logging. This allows you to send structured logs from your local Node.js development environment directly to your Google Cloud project, providing a unified logging experience for both local and live scripts.

### Configuration

Logging behavior is controlled by the `LOG_DESTINATION` environment variable in your `.env` file. You can set this value by running the interactive `setup.sh` script or by editing the file manually.

| `LOG_DESTINATION`   | Behavior                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONSOLE` (Default) | Logs structured JSON to the local console (`stdout`).                                                  |
| `CLOUD`             | Sends logs directly to Google Cloud Logging. Nothing is written to the local console.                |
| `BOTH`              | Sends logs to both Google Cloud Logging and the local console.                                       |
| `NONE`              | Disables all output from `Logger.log()`.                                                             |

When logging to the cloud, entries are sent to the `gas-fakes/console_logs` log name and include the following labels for easy filtering in the Cloud Logging Log Explorer:
- `gas-fakes-scriptId`
- `gas-fakes-userId`

### Dynamic Control and Usage

You can also change the logging destination at any time during runtime by setting the `Logger.__logDestination` property.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Set in .env: LOG_DESTINATION="CLOUD"

// This log goes only to Google Cloud Logging
Logger.log('Initial log entry to the cloud.');

// Switch to logging to both destinations
Logger.__logDestination = 'BOTH';
Logger.log({ message: 'This entry goes to cloud and console', severity: 'WARNING' });

// You can get a direct link to the logs for the current session
console.log('Cloud Log Link for this session:', Logger.__cloudLogLink);
```

## Upstash Integration for Shared Data Stores

You can now configure `gas-fakes` to use Upstash Redis as a backend for `PropertiesService` and `CacheService`. This powerful feature allows you to share data between your local Node.js environment and a live Apps Script project, enabling true cross-environment integration testing. See [getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) for more details on how
