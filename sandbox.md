# <img src="./logo.png" alt="gas-fakes logo" width="50" align="top"> `gas-fakes` Sandbox Mode

`gas-fakes` includes a powerful sandbox feature that allows you to control file access and manage test artifacts, ensuring your tests are isolated, predictable, and clean.

## The `ScriptApp.__behavior` Object

All sandbox configurations are managed through the global `ScriptApp.__behavior` object. This object is your central point for enabling, disabling, and fine-tuning the sandbox environment.

## Global Sandbox Controls

You can set the overall behavior of the sandbox using these top-level properties.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sandboxMode` | `boolean` | `false` | When `true`, file access is restricted. By default, only files created during the current session are accessible. |
| `strictSandbox` | `boolean` | `true` | When `true` (and `sandboxMode` is active), any attempt to access a non-whitelisted, non-session file will throw an error. If `false`, access is allowed, which is useful for debugging but doesn't strictly emulate the `drive.file` scope. |
| `cleanup` | `boolean` | `true` | If `true`, calling `ScriptApp.__behavior.trash()` will move all files created during the session to the Google Drive trash. Set to `false` to leave test artifacts for inspection. |

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Enable sandbox mode at the start of your test suite
ScriptApp.__behavior.sandboxMode = true;

// Your test code...
const myFile = DriveApp.createFile('test.txt', 'hello');

// This will succeed because the file was created in the current session
const retrievedFile = DriveApp.getFileById(myFile.getId());

// This would fail because the file ID was not created in this session and is not whitelisted
// const otherFile = DriveApp.getFileById('some-other-id');

// At the end of your test run, clean up all created files
ScriptApp.__behavior.trash();
```

## File Access Control: The Whitelist

When you need to access specific, pre-existing files (like templates or test data fixtures) in strict sandbox mode, you can add their IDs to a whitelist.

### `IdWhitelistItem`

You create whitelist entries using `behavior.newIdWhitelistItem(id)`. Each item can be configured with specific permissions.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `setRead(boolean)` | Allows read operations (e.g., `openById`, `getName`). Defaults to `true`. |
| `setWrite(boolean)` | Allows write operations (e.g., `setContent`, `appendParagraph`). Defaults to `false`. |
| `setTrash(boolean)` | Allows the file to be trashed (`setTrashed(true)`). Defaults to `false`. |

### Whitelist Management Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `addIdWhitelist(item)` | Adds an `IdWhitelistItem` to the list. |
| `removeIdWhitelist(id)` | Removes an item from the list by its ID. |
| `clearIdWhitelist()` | Clears all items from the whitelist. |
| `setIdWhitelist(items)` | Replaces the entire whitelist with a new array of `IdWhitelistItem`s. |

### Whitelist Example

```javascript
const behavior = ScriptApp.__behavior;
behavior.sandboxMode = true;
behavior.strictSandbox = true;

const TEMPLATE_DOC_ID = 'your-template-doc-id';
const LOG_SHEET_ID = 'your-log-sheet-id';

// Whitelist a document for reading only
const readOnlyItem = behavior.newIdWhitelistItem(TEMPLATE_DOC_ID);

// Whitelist a spreadsheet for reading, writing, and trashing
const readWriteItem = behavior.newIdWhitelistItem(LOG_SHEET_ID)
  .setWrite(true)
  .setTrash(true);

behavior.setIdWhitelist([readOnlyItem, readWriteItem]);

// --- Accessing whitelisted files ---

// This succeeds (read is allowed)
const doc = DocumentApp.openById(TEMPLATE_DOC_ID);
console.log(doc.getName());

// This fails (write is not allowed for the doc)
try {
  doc.getBody().appendParagraph('This will fail.');
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // Write access to file ... is denied
}

// This succeeds (write is allowed for the sheet)
const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(LOG_SHEET_ID);
sheet.getRange('A1').setValue('Log entry');

// This succeeds (trash is allowed for the sheet)
DriveApp.getFileById(LOG_SHEET_ID).setTrashed(true);
```

## Granular Per-Service Controls

For even more fine-grained control, you can define specific sandbox behaviors for individual services (`DriveApp`, `SpreadsheetApp`, `DocumentApp`, `SlidesApp`, and their advanced service counterparts). Per-service settings override the global settings.

Settings for a service are accessed via `ScriptApp.__behavior.sandboxService.<ServiceName>`.

| Property | Type | Default (Effective) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Set to `false` to completely disable all methods of this service. |
| `sandboxMode` | `boolean` | Global `sandboxMode` | Overrides the global `sandboxMode` for this service only. |
| `strictSandbox` | `boolean` | Global `strictSandbox` | Overrides the global `strictSandbox` for this service only. |
| `methodWhitelist` | `string[]` | `null` (all allowed) | An array of method names that are permitted. If set, any call to a method not in this array will throw an error. |

### Per-Service Configuration Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `clear()` | Resets all settings for a specific service, causing it to inherit from the global configuration again. |
| `addMethodWhitelist(name)` | Adds a method name to the service's whitelist. |
| `removeMethodWhitelist(name)` | Removes a method name from the whitelist. |
| `clearMethodWhitelist()` | Clears the method whitelist for the service. |

### Advanced Examples

#### Disabling a Service

**Note:** Most services (`SpreadsheetApp`, `DocumentApp`, etc.) depend on `DriveApp` for file operations. Disabling `DriveApp` while other services are enabled will have no effect.

```javascript
// Disable DocumentApp, but allow other services to work
ScriptApp.__behavior.sandboxService.DocumentApp.enabled = false;

// This will throw an error
try {
  DocumentApp.create('wont-work');
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // "DocumentApp service is disabled..."
}

// This will still work
const ss = SpreadsheetApp.create("My Sheet");
```

#### Restricting Methods

**Note:** Certain core methods (like `getFileById`) are essential for a service to function and may be implicitly allowed even if not in the whitelist.

```javascript
// In DriveApp, only allow creating folders and getting files by name.
const driveSettings = ScriptApp.__behavior.sandboxService.DriveApp;
driveSettings.setMethodWhitelist(['createFolder', 'getFilesByName']);

// This will succeed
const newFolder = DriveApp.createFolder("My Test Folder");

// This will throw an error
try {
  const root = DriveApp.getRootFolder();
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // "Method DriveApp.getRootFolder is not allowed..."
}
```
