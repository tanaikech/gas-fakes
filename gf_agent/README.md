# gf_agent - Google Apps Script Local Automation Agent

`gf_agent` is an interactive agent for Gemini CLI that allows you to automate Google Workspace tasks locally using [gas-fakes](https://github.com/brucemcpherson/gas-fakes).

*For full project details, see the [main gas-fakes README](../README.md).*

## Requirements & Setup

Before using the agent or the MCP tools, you **must** configure your local environment to allow access to your Google Workspace account:

1. **Manifest File**: You need a local `appsscript.json` file in your directory containing the necessary `oauthScopes` you intend to use.
2. **Initialization**: Run `gas-fakes init` to generate a `.env` file and configure your auth parameters.
3. **Authentication**: Run `gas-fakes auth` to log in and generate the tokens required to run the scripts.

## Installation & Integration

*Note: You can skip these manual steps if you already chose to install the Gemini skills during the `gas-fakes init` process.*

### 1. Install the Skill Agent


You can install the `gf_agent` directly from this repository. To install **only** this skill:
```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/brucemcpherson/gas-fakes.git --path gf_agent
```
*Note: This repository contains multiple specialized skills (for development, maintenance, etc.). Omitting the `--path` flag will install all of them.*

### 2. Configure the MCP Server
To use Google Workspace services as tools within Gemini CLI, add the MCP server to your settings. 

The easiest way is to use the built-in command (assuming you installed `gas-fakes` globally):
```bash
gemini mcp add --scope project gas-fakes-mcp gas-fakes mcp
```

*(Advanced: Alternatively, you can manually add the configuration to your `.gemini/settings.json` file instead of using the command above. See [documentation.md](documentation.md) for the manual JSON structure).*

### 3. Requirements
Ensure dependencies are installed in your workspace:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once the MCP server is configured, you don't need to use any special prefixes or agent names. Simply describe what you want to do in plain English:

- "Create a sheet called 'Latest Drive Files' and add my recently created Drive files to it."
- "Find latest 5 emails from 'Martin Hawksey' and summarize them in a Google Doc."
- "Add a meeting with Martin Hawksey to my calendar for tomorrow at 10am. Subject is gas-fakes agent"
- "Find my airports spreadsheet, and using the sheet with the most data, list to the console the 5 highest airports sorted by elevation high to low, and convert elevation to meters.

The LLM will automatically:
1. Identify the correct Google Workspace services needed.
2. Generate the appropriate Apps Script code.
3. Execute it locally via `gas-fakes`.
4. Confirm the results to you.

## Antigravity & MCP Integration

`gas-fakes` can also act as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for tools like Antigravity. To launch the MCP server:

```bash
gas-fakes mcp
```

This allows Antigravity or other MCP-compatible clients to call Google Workspace tools directly through `gas-fakes`.


## Why use gf_agent?

- **Fast Iteration**: Test your automation logic without waiting for the Apps Script IDE or deployment.
- **Security**: Run tasks locally using your own Google credentials (via ADC) without uploading code to a third-party service.
- **Powerful Integration**: Use Node.js libraries alongside Google Apps Script APIs.
