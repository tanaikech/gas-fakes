### <img src="./logo.png" alt="gas-fakes logo" width="50" align="top"> How Named Ranges Are Used to Track Element Identity

The core challenge in emulating `DocumentApp` is understanding how Apps Script objects, like a `Paragraph`, remain "alive" and valid even after the document is modified and their position changes.

```javascript
// Live Apps Script Example
var body = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getBody();
var p2 = body.appendParagraph("Paragraph 2");

// Now, insert a new paragraph before p2
body.insertParagraph(1, "A new paragraph before p2"); 

// Even though p2 has shifted, this still works!
p2.setText("Paragraph 2 has been updated."); 
```

The `p2` object somehow "knows" where it is in the document, even though its character indices (`startIndex`, `endIndex`) have changed. A simple approach of just storing an element's `startIndex` would fail immediately after the first insertion or deletion.

### The Solution: Named Ranges as Stable Anchors

`gas-fakes` solves this by using the Google Docs API's **Named Range** feature as a persistent, stable "tag" for every structural element in the document.

Here’s the step-by-step process:

#### 1. Initial "Tagging" on Document Load

When a `FakeDocument` is opened or refreshed, `gas-fakes` performs a full scan of the document's structure using the advanced `Docs.Documents.get()` method.

*   For every structural element it finds (a `PARAGRAPH`, `LIST_ITEM`, `TABLE`, etc.), it creates a corresponding **unique named range** in the live Google Doc.
*   This named range is given a unique, randomly generated name, like `GAS_FAKE_body_PARAGRAPH_13260ced-7174-4bb9-b7e8-f39d1ad662a1`.
*   This name becomes the **stable, unique identifier** for that specific element instance.

#### 2. The `FakeElement` Object's Identity

When `gas-fakes` returns an element object to your script (e.g., the `FakeParagraph` returned by `body.appendParagraph()`), that object doesn't just know its current position. Its most important internal property is this unique named range name, stored in `this.__name`.

This `__name` is the element's "soul." It's the key that allows the object to find itself again, no matter how the document changes around it.

#### 3. The "Self-Healing" Mechanism on Method Calls

When you call a method on a `FakeParagraph` object, like `p2.getText()`, the following happens:

1.  The `FakeParagraph` object accesses its internal `__elementMapItem` property.
2.  This is a dynamic getter that first tries to find the element in its local document model (`shadowDocument`) using its last known name (`this.__name`).
3.  If the document has been modified and that name is no longer valid (the "stale reference" problem), the getter uses a fallback: it finds the element based on its **original `startIndex`** that was cached when the object was first created.
4.  Once it finds the element at the new position, it retrieves the element's **new unique name** from the refreshed document model and updates its own `this.__name`.
5.  With the "revived" element data, the `getText()` method can now execute correctly.

#### 4. The Critical Importance of Named Range Protection

The self-healing mechanism described above only works if the element's identity is preserved in the live document across API calls.

*   **The Problem:** We discovered that when you send a `batchUpdate` request that modifies content (like `insertText` or `deleteContentRange`), the Docs API will often **move or delete** the named ranges that overlap with the modification. This breaks the link between our `FakeElement` object and its representation in the document.

*   **The Solution (The Core Principle):** To prevent this, any `batchUpdate` that modifies an element's content **must also include requests to protect its named range**. This is done by atomically:
    1.  `deleteNamedRange`: Deleting the old named range by its ID.
    2.  `createNamedRange`: Immediately recreating it with the **exact same name** but with the new, correct character range.

By doing this in a single `batchUpdate`, we are explicitly telling the Docs API: "I am changing this element, but I want it to keep its identity." This ensures that when the `shadowDocument` refreshes, it can still find the named range and the `FakeElement` object remains valid. This protection is the key to the entire system's stability.
